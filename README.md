## Description

This is a recreation of the classic arcade game Galaga. It is different in a few senses as all the enemies have linear movement. However, it maintains a similar design and appearance. 
It maintains a highscore which can be achieved by destroying enemies. There is no win condition, you just have to try to get the highest score.

### Features:
* 50 points for each enemy destroyed
* 3 lives
* 3 times the level enemies are spawned at each level

### Controls:
* Left and right arrow to move left and right
* Z to shoot a bullet

### Custom Font:

To use the custom arcade font, install the font from the arcade_font.ttf file in resources.

### Note:
Do note edit the highscore.txt file as that will mess up the highscore feature.
