# Final Project Proposal

I intend to create a replica of the classic game Galaga, which will implement level, score, and life systems. I believe 
that the work I am doing and have done with the Ideal Gas Simulation will serve to be very useful in terms of sprite/particle
interactions. Despite that, I think it will offer many new challenges that arise in a graphical game that require alot of 
real-time interactions from the user.

## Week 1

The first week I can work with the controlling of the player's character and how the attack mechanic works. This will
require me to figure out how drawing a more complicated sprite works with Cinder. As of right now, I really just know
how to draw circles and rectangles, but game sprites will require a lot more than just simple shapes. Once I figure out,
how to generate more complex sprites, creates these simple mechanics should be pretty simple.

## Week 2

This week I hope to create levels of randomly generated enemies. The difficulty should increase either by the capabilities
of the enemies or the number of enemies that need to be dealt with. This will be the stage I work on variation of sprites,
which likely will not be a simple task. At this point I will also determine win thresholds and plan out how I want that
to work with the scores.

## Week 3

At this point, the brunt of the work is already done. I can now add the the UI by implementing the final version of the
level, score, and life systems. These should work together without friction and be displayed in an aesthetic manner. If
I end up finishing early, I could make enhancements that have to do with changing the attacks. For example, I could offer
the choice between different attack moves with different disadvantages and advantages. A few other ideas are a leaderboard
and 2-player support.
